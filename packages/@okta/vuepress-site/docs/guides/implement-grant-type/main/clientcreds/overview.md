The Client Credentials flow is recommended for server-side (AKA confidential) client applications with no end user, which normally describes machine-to-machine communication. Your application needs to securely store its Client ID and secret and pass those to Okta in exchange for an access token. At a high-level, the flow only has two steps:

- Your application passes its client credentials to your Okta Authorization Server.
- If the credentials are accurate, Okta responds with an access token.

See our [OAuth 2.0 overview](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#client-credentials-flow) for more information on the Client Credentials flow.
